## 🌟 What is GAC?

Git Auto Commit (GAC) is an intelligent CLI tool that leverages AI to generate meaningful,
context-aware commit messages based on your staged changes. Built with functional programming
principles, GAC simplifies your Git workflow by automatically crafting descriptive commit messages.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 AI-Generated Commit Messages
- 🧩 Multi-Provider API Support (Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, Mistral)
- 🌐 Local Model Integration (Ollama)
- 🔧 Automatic Code Formatting
- 🚀 Functional Programming Design

## 🔌 Development Status

This project is under active development and not yet available via package managers. To try it out:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cellwebb/gac.git
cd gac

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

## Installation

### Using pipx (recommended)

To install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/yourusername/git-auto-commit.git
```

For a specific version or branch:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/yourusername/git-auto-commit.git@branch-or-tag
```

## 🎬 Usage

1. Stage your changes:

```bash
git add .
```

2. Generate a commit message:

```bash
gac
```

## 🛠 Configuration

### AI Provider Setup

1. Get an API key from your preferred provider
2. Set the environment variables:

```bash
export GAC_MODEL=anthropic:claude-3-5-haiku-latest
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Interactive Configuration

```bash
# Run configuration wizard
gac --config
```

The configuration wizard guides you through selecting:

- Your preferred AI provider
- The specific model to use
- Code formatting preferences

Your choices are automatically saved to a `.gac.env` file in your home directory, making them
persistent across terminal sessions.

### Configuration Files

GAC supports several configuration methods:

- `.gac.env` file in your home directory (created by configuration wizard)
- Local `.env` file in your project directory
- Environment variables in your current shell session

Priority order: Environment variables > Local `.env` > Home `.gac.env` > Defaults

## 🌈 Advanced Usage

```bash
# Stage all changes and commit
gac -a

# Automatically confirm suggested commit message (use at your own risk)
gac -f

# Automatically push after committing (use at your own risk)
gac -p

# Generate one-line commit message
gac -o

# Provide context hint
gac -h "Fix authentication bug"

# All together now
gac -afpo -h "Fixing JIRA ticket #420"

```

## Configuration Wizard

When you run the configuration wizard, you will first select your preferred AI provider. After
selecting the provider, you will be prompted to **enter the model name manually** instead of
selecting from a predefined list. This allows for greater flexibility in choosing models without the
need to maintain a list of available options.

### Steps:

1. **Select AI Provider:** Choose from the list of supported AI providers (`anthropic`, `openai`,
   `groq`, `mistral`).
2. **Enter Model Name:** Manually input the model name you wish to use.
3. **Formatting Preference:** Choose whether to enable automatic Python file formatting.
4. **Save Configuration:** Decide whether to save these settings to your `.env` file.

### Example

```bash
$ gac configure
