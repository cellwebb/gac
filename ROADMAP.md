# Git Auto Commit (gac) Project Roadmap

## Current Status

Git Auto Commit (gac) is a CLI tool that uses large language models to generate meaningful commit
messages based on staged changes. We have completed a major architectural shift toward functional
programming, emphasizing pure functions, immutability, and composability. The codebase now follows a
functional paradigm with improved type hints, better error handling, and a more streamlined
architecture. We have significantly improved test coverage, particularly for the main.py and ai.py
modules. The codebase has been simplified by removing deprecated functions and unnecessary
parameters.

## Long-term Vision

Our simplified vision is to:

2. **Functional Purity**: Maintain high functional purity for maintainability and reliability
3. **Developer Experience**: Provide a consistent and intuitive API for developers
4. **Performance**: Optimize for speed and efficiency in the commit workflow
5. **Extensibility**: Create a plugin architecture for extending functionality
6. **Customization**: Add support for user-defined prompt templates and configuration

## Explicitly Not Planned

We've decided against these items to maintain focus:

- ~~CLI subcommand structure (gac commit, gac config, etc.)~~
- ~~Command completion for shells~~
- ~~Web-based configuration interface~~
- ~~VS Code/IDE extensions~~
- ~~Semantic versioning support~~
- ~~Multilingual commit messages~~
- ~~Complex class hierarchies and abstractions~~
- ~~Refactoring to more "elegant" but harder-to-maintain patterns~~
- ~~Create a pipeline factory for the commit workflow~~
- ~~Implement pipeline pattern for data transformation~~
- ~~Reduce startup time through lazy imports~~
- ~~Caching mechanisms of any kind~~ - We will NEVER implement caching since it is of minimal
  benefit in our use case where text content rarely repeats

## Token Optimization Strategy

### Current Implementation

Our token optimization strategy focuses on intelligent handling of large diffs and AI model
interactions:

1. **Smart Truncation**

   - Dynamically truncate git diffs based on token limits
   - Preserve critical context while reducing overall token count
   - Implement model-specific tokenization strategies

2. **Intelligent Token Counting**

   - Use `tiktoken` for accurate token counting across different models
   - Support multiple encoding strategies (Claude, OpenAI, etc.)
   - Dynamically select appropriate tokenization method

3. **Diff Processing**
   - Prioritize meaningful changes over large, auto-generated files
   - Skip known large file patterns (lock files, build artifacts)
   - Implement token-aware diff selection

### Future Enhancements

- Develop additional configurable token limit settings
- Create more adaptive truncation algorithms
- Improve context preservation during diff reduction
- Add support for more AI model tokenization strategies

### Technical Challenges

- Maintaining semantic meaning while reducing token count
- Handling diverse file types and programming languages
- Balancing performance with comprehensive context

### Guiding Principles

- Minimize token usage without losing critical information
- Provide transparent, predictable truncation
- Support multiple AI providers with different tokenization methods
