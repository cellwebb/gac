# Git Auto Commit (gac) Project Roadmap

## Current Status

Git Auto Commit (gac) is a CLI tool that uses large language models to generate meaningful commit messages based on staged changes. We have completed a major architectural shift toward functional programming, emphasizing pure functions, immutability, and composability. The codebase now follows a functional paradigm with improved type hints, better error handling, and a more streamlined architecture.

## Next Steps

## Long-term Vision

Our simplified vision is to:

1. **Core Functionality**: Generate excellent commit messages using AI with minimal complexity
2. **Functional Purity**: Maintain high functional purity for maintainability and reliability
3. **Developer Experience**: Provide a consistent and intuitive API for developers
4. **Performance**: Optimize for speed and efficiency in the commit workflow
5. **Extensibility**: Create a plugin architecture for extending functionality
6. **Customization**: Add support for user-defined prompt templates and configuration

## Explicitly Not Planned

We've decided against these items to maintain focus:

- ~~Command completion for shells~~
- ~~Web-based configuration interface~~
- ~~VS Code/IDE extensions~~
- ~~Semantic versioning support~~
- ~~Multilingual commit messages~~
- ~~Complex class hierarchies and abstractions~~
- ~~Refactoring to more "elegant" but harder-to-maintain patterns~~
- ~~Create a pipeline factory for the commit workflow~~
- ~~Implement pipeline pattern for data transformation~~
- ~~Reduce startup time through lazy imports~~

## Reconsidered Items

Items we originally ruled out but have reconsidered:

- **Adding new AI providers**: Will selectively add support for promising new models
- **Interactive mode**: Planning to add limited interactive refinement capability
- **Request retry mechanisms**: Will implement to improve reliability
