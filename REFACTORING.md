# GAC Codebase Refactoring

This document outlines the significant architectural improvements made to the GAC codebase.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Simplified Module Structure

The codebase has been reorganized into a more logical and streamlined structure:

```
gac/
├── ai.py               # AI provider integration (replaces ai_utils.py)
├── cli.py              # CLI entry point (simplified)
├── core.py             # Core business logic
├── format.py           # Consolidated formatting logic
├── git.py              # Git operations
├── prompt.py           # Prompt building/cleaning logic
├── config.py           # Configuration handling
└── errors.py           # Error types and handling
```

### 2. Functional-Based Approach

The code now uses a more functional approach, reducing unnecessary classes:

- Replaced `CommitWorkflow` with simpler `generate_commit()` and `commit_changes()` functions
- Removed `CommitManager` in favor of direct AI interaction through `ai.py`
- Consolidated formatting logic into `format.py` with clearer function interfaces

### 3. API Design Improvements

- Reduced parameter count with sensible defaults and configuration
- Made each function focus on a single responsibility
- Improved error handling with more specific error types
- Better separation of concerns between modules

### 4. Architectural Benefits

- **Reduced complexity**: Eliminated unnecessary layers of abstraction
- **Better maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Simplified testing**: Pure functions are easier to test
- **Improved readability**: More consistent coding style
- **Easier extensibility**: Clear extension points for new features

## Migrating from the Old API

If you were using the old class-based API:

```python
# Old API
from gac.workflow import CommitWorkflow
workflow = CommitWorkflow(
    force=True,
    add_all=True,
    no_format=False
)
workflow.run()
```

You can now use the simplified functional API:

```python
# New API
from gac.core import commit_changes
commit_changes(
    force=True,
    add_all=True,
    formatting=True
)
```

The CLI interface remains backward compatible, so all existing command-line options continue to work as before.
