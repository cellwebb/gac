# GAC Codebase Improvements

## Summary of Changes

In this refactoring, we've addressed key architectural issues with the GAC codebase to improve
maintainability, simplify the API, and make the code more testable. The changes include:

1. **Simplified module structure**: Reorganized code into focused modules with clear
   responsibilities.
2. **Function-based API**: Replaced class-based architecture with a simpler functional approach.
3. **Reduced dependencies**: Minimized dependencies between modules.
4. **Better error handling**: Streamlined error hierarchy.
5. **Compatibility layer**: Added backward compatibility for existing code and tests.

## Key Modules

### New Structure

```text
gac/
├── ai.py               # AI provider integration
├── cli.py              # CLI entry point
├── core.py             # Main business logic functions
├── format.py           # Code formatting functions
├── git.py              # Git operations
├── prompt.py           # Prompt handling functions
├── config.py           # Configuration management
└── errors.py           # Error types and handling
```

## API Improvements

### Before

```python
# Creating and running a workflow
workflow = CommitWorkflow(
    force=True, add_all=True, no_format=False,
    quiet=False, model="anthropic:claude-3-haiku",
    hint="Fix the logging issue"
)
workflow.run()
```

### After

```python
# Simple function call
from gac.core import commit_changes

commit_changes(
    force=True, add_all=True, formatting=True,
    quiet=False, model="anthropic:claude-3-haiku",
    hint="Fix the logging issue"
)
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced complexity**: Eliminated unnecessary abstractions and layers.
2. **Improved maintainability**: Each module has a clear, focused responsibility.
3. **Better testability**: Pure functions are easier to test.
4. **Simpler API**: More intuitive, function-based API.
5. **Backward compatibility**: All existing code and CLI options continue to work.
6. **Future extensibility**: Clearer extension points for new features.

## Migration

For users of the API, we recommend migrating to the new function-based API when convenient, but the
compatibility layer ensures that existing code will continue to work without modification.

See REFACTORING.md for more details on the new architecture and migration recommendations.
